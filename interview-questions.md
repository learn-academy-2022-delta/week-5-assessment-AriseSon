## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: A RESTful route is a route that provides mapping from HTTP verbs (get, post, put, delete, patch) to controller CRUD actions (create, read, update, delete). Instead of relying solely on the URL to indicate what site to visit, a RESTful route depends on the HTTP verb and the URL.

2. JSON: JavaScript Object Notation, more commonly known by the acronym JSON, is an open data interchange format that is both human and machine-readable. Despite the name JavaScript Object Notation, JSON is independent of any programming language and is a common API output in a wide variety of applications.

3. ERB: ERB (or Ruby code generated by ERB ) returns a string in the same character encoding as the input string. When the input string has a magic comment, however, it returns a string in the encoding specified by the magic comment.

4. Params: params is an alias for the parameters method. params comes from ActionController::Base, which is accessed by your application via ApplicationController. Specifically, params refers to the parameters being passed to the controller via a GET or POST request.

5. API: API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API.
